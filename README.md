# QuickClip-project
 A lightweight, cross-platform clipboard manager that keeps track of everything you copy, so you never lose important snippets again!
QuickClip runs in the background, automatically saving your clipboard history to a local database. Press Ctrl+Shift+V to view your recent clips and quickly paste them again.
